# 🔐 Escrow Smart Contract dApp

A full-stack Ethereum Escrow Contract built with **Hardhat + React + Ethers.js**, deployed on **Sepolia Testnet** and designed to simulate real-world on-chain approval flows.

This dApp allows a **Depositor, Arbiter, and Beneficiary** to interact through a trust-minimized escrow contract with features such as:

On-chain contract deployment
- Arbiter approval
- Refund after 60-minute deadline
- Live contract state updates
- Import existing deployed contracts
- UI tutorial & structured onboarding

## 🚀 Features
🔹 **1. Create Escrow Contracts**

Users can deploy a new smart contract by providing:

1. Arbiter Address

2. Beneficiary Address

3. Deposit Amount (ETH)
>Sender's wallet becomes the Depositor, automatically.

🔹 **2. Arbiter Approval**

Only **the Arbiter** can approve the contract.<br>
Approval immediately releases the deposit to the Beneficiary.

🔹 **3. Refund After Deadline**

Each contract has:

>60-minute deadline


If the Arbiter does **not** approve within the time window:

- The **Depositor** can manually trigger a refund.

🔹 **4. Import Existing Contracts**

Users can load any already-deployed escrow contract by entering its address.

🔹 **5. Live UI State Updates**

The frontend tracks and displays:

- Status: *Pending, Approved, Refunded, Deadline Passed*

- Countdown timer until deadline

- Role-aware buttons (only Arbiter sees “Approve”, etc.)

🔹 **6. Sepolia Testnet Support**

This app is configured for live testing using:

- Alchemy RPC

- Sepolia ETH (faucet funded)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ **Clone the project**
```
git clone https://github.com/titananrch/Alchemy-week5-Escrow-Hardhat.git
cd Alchemy-week5-Escrow-Hardhat
```
2️⃣ **Install dependencies**
1. Root (Hardhat)
```
npm install
```
2. React frontend
```
cd app
npm install
```
3️⃣ **Environment Variables**<br>
**Root .env (required for deployments)**

Create a .env in the root folder:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your-sepolia-wallet-private-key
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-key
```

Used by:<br>
✔ Hardhat deploy script<br>
✔ Hardhat network config


**Frontend .env** *(optional)*

If you want to keep RPC URL in the frontend:

/app/.env:
```
VITE_ALCHEMY_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-key
```

>Frontend does not use PRIVATE_KEY — only the wallet extension signs transactions.

### 📡 Deploying the Smart Contract to Sepolia

From root folder:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

This outputs:
```
Escrow deployed at: 0x.....

Copy this address if you want to load it later via **Import Existing Contract.**
